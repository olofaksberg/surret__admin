### APP DESCRIPTION

surret-admin is an admintool application for a beekeeping friend of mine.
It's a CRUD-app (create, read, update, delete) that helps my friend keeping a good view of orders, products and markets.
Here's a short description of what you're able to do within the different main categories:

Products:

- See productinformation. That includes adminonly info such as "balance (lagersaldo)", "orderamount (antal s√•lda totalt)".
- Add products. Add one or multiple products at the time, and get a preview of the result productcards before you confirm.
- Edit products.
- Delete products.

Markets:

- See marketinformation.
- Add markets. Add one or multiple markets at the time, and get a preview of the result marketcards before you confirm. A market can also be populated with products that you'll sell at the market.
- Edit markets. That includes adding or removing products from the market.
- Delete markets.

Orders:

- See orderinformation. That includes the state of the order; "active" or "old" ("mottagen" eller "arkiverad"), when the order was made, when the state was changed and, of course, customerinformation and products.
- Edit orderstatus. When the order is considered done, you can put the order in "the archive".

### TO BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT

- Testing
- The main categories "News" and "Resellers".
- Login and proper authentication.
- Mail notification to customer when their order is on the way.
- Backend cleanup
- ...

### PROJECT GOAL

- My main focus this project has been to improve my React code and structure.
- Implement React Redux and Redux Toolkit which I haven't tried before. I will never (well..) do a React project without using it in the future :)
- Try out TypeScript.

### FINAL THOUGHTS

I'm pretty happy with the result so far. Big improvement since my last project.
